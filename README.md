This project is a Logistics Parcel Tracking System developed using Java and JDBC.
It is a console-based application that manages parcel creation, shipment processing, and delivery tracking.
The system allows creating parcels, grouping them into shipments, and recording scans and delivery attempts.
Users can view parcel status and shipment summary through menu-driven options.
All data operations are handled using JDBC for database connectivity.
This project is useful for learning JDBC, layered architecture, and real-world logistics workflows.
